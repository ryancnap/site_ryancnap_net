				// Article text goes inbetween these two paragraphs.
				So obviously this is a site generally about software engineering and development, and really anything that falls, however remotely, into the realms of Computer Science. I think I'll skip a fluffy introductory post and jump straight to a very common question when people are coming into this industry: the issue of misleading degree names.

				There's alot of confusion over what degrees match with what generalized area of computer science an individual wants to go into. Let's look at the three most popular options today:
				<ul>
					<li>Computer Science (probably the most common/popular</li>
					<li>Computer Engineering</li>
					<li>Software Engineering (unfortunately fairly rare)</li>
				</ul>
