		<h1>About</h1>

		<h3 id="article_title">Ryan Camaratta</h3>

		<div id="article_container">
			<p id="article_text">
				I'm an entry-level, self-taught software developer. I choose to persue the engineering of software because I like seeing the way the world's adapted to solving it's complex problems, and the systems we have to put in place to manage these solutions. I like methodical problem-solving, and I tend to think like a perfectionist, so I decided
				that the development and design of software was a good place for me.
			</p>

			<p id="article_text">
				Currently, I work in Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I'm hoping to add a statically-typed, compiled language to my repertoire soon, once I gain some more thorough understanding of my current toolset. Some frameworks I work in include pygame, phaser.io, and Django.
			</p>

			<p id="article_text">
				I'm by no means an expert, but I try to generalize as much as I can.
				I started writing code when I was around twelve or thirteen, when I got fed up with my first-ever computer and wanted to make it do more. Searching eventually led me to find programming, and I taught myself some really basic C after fooling around with GameMaker and finding it too limiting. A sub-par freshman class in C++ almost drove me away from software; spending an entire year learning that you <em>need</em> an IDE is enough to make me crazy, and a classroom of distracted people trying to learn introductory OOP concepts when they don't know what return values for functions are is quite frankly a slow-burning hell.
			</p>

			<p id="article_text">
				So after a couple of years of misinformation, and after giving up my half-baked childhood interest, I lucked out after I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket and was searching for ways to improve the sub-par battery life. I found the xda-developers forums, and it's all uphill from there. I got interested in the technical side of things again, got involved in an amazing community, and decided to pick up my interest again, this time wiser and armed with industry-standard processes like agile development, TDD and well written unit/integration tests, as well as a great appreciation for things like continuous integration and distributed version control systems. (And like four years of constantly reading everything and anything I could find that even loosely related to software, that helped alot.)
			</p>

			<p id="article_text">
				I've since fallen a little way from the fragmented android dev scene, and I'm trying new domains and tools and languages as I run into them, need them, or find them interesting for skills-building personal projects. It's taken a very long time for me to get even this far, and I may have started later than alot of people, but this is something I intend to see through to the end as a career, hobby, and passion. You can find me as @ryancnap on most social networking sites and on IRC, or check out some of my work on github.
